    <p>Lemon juice is a tangy, citrus-flavored liquid extracted from fresh lemons. Known for its sharp, refreshing taste, it is rich in vitamin C and often used to enhance the flavor of food and drinks. Its natural acidity makes it a popular ingredient in marinades, salad dressings, and beverages, as well as a natural preservative and cleaning agent. Lemon juice also adds a zesty brightness to both sweet and savory dishes.</p>
